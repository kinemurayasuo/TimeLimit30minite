# Quote of the Day

This project is a simple web application that displays a new quote each day.

- **Background Color Change**: The background color of the page changes randomly each time a new quote is fetched, adding a visual flair.
- **Share on Twitter**: Clicking the 'Tweet' button allows you to instantly share the current quote on your Twitter account.
- **Loading State**: While a new quote is being fetched, the button is disabled and displays "Loading..." to inform the user of the loading state.
